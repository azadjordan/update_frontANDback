Hey Guys, this is an extension for the project with UPDATE functionality on both frontend and backend.
Check the following files:

1) backend/controllers/workoutController.js
in this file at the update section, we send a request to mongoDB to update the file, and if the response was ok we send the updated workout to the frontend.

2) frontend/src/components
Here I modified the code in WorkoutDetails, and created WorkoutEdit component.

Enjoy <3
